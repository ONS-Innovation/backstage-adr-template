# ADR Template

To ensure consistency, discoverability, and traceability across all projects, Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) must follow the standards below:
 
All ADRs should be stored in a dedicated directory within the code repository:
 
- `/docs/adr/`
 
This ensures ADRs are version-controlled alongside the codebase and easily accessible to all contributors.

## Naming Convention

Each ADR file must follow the naming pattern:

`adr-<sequence-number>-<short-title>.md`

Examples:

- adr-001-use-postgresql.md
- adr-002-adopt-terraform.md
- adr-003-deprecate-legacy-auth.md
